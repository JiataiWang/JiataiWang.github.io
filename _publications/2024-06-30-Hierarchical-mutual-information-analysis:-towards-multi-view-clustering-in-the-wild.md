category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-06-30-Hierarchical-mutual-information-analysis:-towards-multi-view-clustering-in-the-wild
excerpt: 'We introduce a hierarchically consistent deep multi‐view clustering framework that first uses dual prediction to recover missing views and achieve instance‐level alignment, then employs contrastive reconstruction for class‐level alignment—significantly outperforming state‐of‐the‐art methods under both view‐missing and unaligned conditions.'
