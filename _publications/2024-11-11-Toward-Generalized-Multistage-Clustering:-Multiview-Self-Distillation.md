excerpt: 'DistilMVC is a multi-stage deep multi-view clustering framework that leverages multi-view self-distillation—using a teacher-student model to distill dark knowledge of pseudo-label distributions—combined with contrastive learning and mutual information maximization across views to correct overconfident pseudo-labels, yielding state-of-the-art clustering performance on real-world datasets.'
