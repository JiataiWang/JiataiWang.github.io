excerpt: 'We introduce CoCo-IMC, an incomplete multi-view clustering framework that employs a dual delayed-activation network to balance complementary and consistent information across views, then recovers missing data by minimizing conditional entropy and maximizing mutual informationâ€”demonstrating superior performance over 12 state-of-the-art baselines on four public datasets.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
